# 6DOF-control-strategy

This repository storages the products of an multivariable deacopled pid control strategy implementated in a 6 DOF UR16e type robot.

The project is divided into 2 products. One contains a simulation using Matlab-Simulink as the environment to test the control strategy with a 3d simulation. The other one has a unity type project with all the necessary files and the application as well.
